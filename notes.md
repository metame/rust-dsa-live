# Rust DSA (the Data structure & algorithm kind of dsa)

## Motivation
We already did this once.
But the videos are long and have background music and it was awhile ago and I was a lot worse at Rust back then (according to my highly skewed view of myself).
So what if we could do a data structure in 2-3 hours and actually finished it one stream/video.
Yay, content
Yay, no background music in VODs so maybe can do other things with them?
Also, great chance for me to practice more Rust and DSA stuff on a personal level (because I have to start interviewing in a couple months)

## Concerns
- Chat distracts me (tbh everything distracts me)
- I still have skill issues
- So not sure if I can actually finish a data structure in a single stream
- I also want to explain some of what the data structure is for those who don't know. Maybe I need a time limit on that at the beginning of vid/stream.

## Stipulations/Rules (I don't like those)
- explain the data structure in five minutes
- It's cheating obviously for me to just look at my old implementations of a data structure
- Not going to look up code examples of the dsa that I'm coding (duh)
- But it's also unlikely that I can finish one quickly if I have to re-remember on stream exactly what the data structure does (e.g. adding/removing from a BST) so it seems that a little pre-stream prep is good.
- A few notes, perhaps shared on screen about the data structure and basic behavior explained in non-code

## Format
- pre-stream (but still possibly live): write intro of blog post
- 5m reading introduction of blog post
- Implement the data structure in < 3 hrs (hopefully)

## What are we going to write
- linear search (slice)
- binary search (slice)
- linked list
- doubly linked list
- rawvec (growable array)
- array list/vec
- FiFo queue (backed by linked list)
- sorting algos (bubble, quick)
- ring buffer
- binary search tree
- priority queue/min heap
- use pq for dijkstra's
- hashmap
- harder stuff (prefix tree/trie, b tree, r/b trees, avl, matrix stuff)

## Blog posts
- write.as
- maybe it makes sense to write the explanatory/introductory section of the blog before stream

### random stuff
- use of radix tree in router: https://docs.rs/matchit/latest/matchit/
- algo viz: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html
